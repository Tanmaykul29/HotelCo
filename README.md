# CS50W Capstone project requirements:

&nbsp;

## Distinctiveness and Complexity
### Why you believe your project satisfies the distinctiveness and complexity requirements, mentioned above.

The project was made from scratch, based on an original idea, following the requirements and trying to implement all methods learned through the lectures and problem sets.

## Whatâ€™s contained in each file you created.

  - `/HotelCo/hotel/static` contains all javascript and css files.

  - `/HotelCo/hotel/templates/hotel` contains all .html files.

All files created and used in the project are described in the [Features](#features) section, with the exception of the following, used more generally:

  - `hotells.js` used to add javascript functionality to add to the user interface.

  - `style.css` used to store all the css specifications.

  - `script.js` used to add javascript functionality to add to the user interface.

## How to run your application.

Described in [Instalation](#instalation) section.

## Any other additional information the staff should know about your project.
Some observations:
- The project allows (and requires, initially) manually book hotel room to it's database.
- `models.py` allows to implement:
<br>
--->  User models to store user database
<br>
--->  Choice models to store checkin, checkout, city, duration into the database
<br>
--->  MyHotels models contains all the 50 hotel for user booking
<br>
--->  Booking models to store hotel name,type of room, price of room and duration of stay
<br>
<br>
To change it's default values, it is needed to access Django's admin interface via /admin.
